  Tool:    bedtools annotate (aka annotateBed)
  Version: v2.25.0
  Summary: Annotates the depth & breadth of coverage of features from mult. files
  	 on the intervals in -i.

  Usage:   bedtools annotate [OPTIONS] -i <bed/gff/vcf> -files FILE1 FILE2..FILEn

  Options: 
  	-names	A list of names (one / file) to describe each file in -i.
  		These names will be printed as a header line.

  	-counts	Report the count of features in each file that overlap -i.
  		- Default is to report the fraction of -i covered by each file.

  	-both	Report the counts followed by the % coverage.
  		- Default is to report the fraction of -i covered by each file.

  	-s	Require same strandedness.  That is, only counts overlaps
  		on the _same_ strand.
  		- By default, overlaps are counted without respect to strand.

  	-S	Require different strandedness.  That is, only count overlaps
  		on the _opposite_ strand.
  		- By default, overlaps are counted without respect to strand.
