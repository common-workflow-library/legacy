  Tool:    bedtools tag (aka tagBam)
  Version: v2.25.0
  Summary: Annotates a BAM file based on overlaps with multiple BED/GFF/VCF files
  	 on the intervals in -i.

  Usage:   bedtools tag [OPTIONS] -i <BAM> -files FILE1 .. FILEn  -labels LAB1 .. LABn

  Options: 
  	-s	Require overlaps on the same strand.  That is, only tag alignments that have the same
  		strand as a feature in the annotation file(s).

  	-S	Require overlaps on the opposite strand.  That is, only tag alignments that have the opposite
  		strand as a feature in the annotation file(s).

  	-f	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of the alignment.
  		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
  		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

  	-tag	Dictate what the tag should be. Default is YB.
  		- STRING (two characters, e.g., YK)

  	-names	Use the name field from the annotation files to populate tags.
  		By default, the -labels values are used.

  	-scores	Use the score field from the annotation files to populate tags.
  		By default, the -labels values are used.

  	-intervals	Use the full interval (including name, score, and strand) to populate tags.
  			Requires the -labels option to identify from which file the interval came.
