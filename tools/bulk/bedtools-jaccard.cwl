  Tool:    bedtools jaccard (aka jaccard)
  Version: v2.25.0
  Summary: Calculate Jaccard statistic b/w two feature files.
  	 Jaccard is the length of the intersection over the union.
  	 Values range from 0 (no intersection) to 1 (self intersection).

  Usage:   bedtools jaccard [OPTIONS] -a <bed/gff/vcf> -b <bed/gff/vcf>

  Options: 
  	-s	Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
  		that overlap A on the _same_ strand.
  		- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

  	-S	Require different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
  		that overlap A on the _opposite_ strand.
  		- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

  	-f	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A.
  		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
  		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

  	-F	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of B.
  		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
  		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

  	-r	Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B.
  		- In other words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires
  		  that B overlap 90% of A and A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.

  	-e	Require that the minimum fraction be satisfied for A OR B.
  		- In other words, if -e is used with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires
  		  that either 90% of A is covered OR 10% of  B is covered.
  		  Without -e, both fractions would have to be satisfied.

  	-split	Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.

  	-g	Provide a genome file to enforce consistent chromosome sort order
  		across input files. Only applies when used with -sorted option.

  	-nonamecheck	For sorted data, don't throw an error if the file has different naming conventions
  			for the same chromosome. ex. "chr1" vs "chr01".

  	-bed	If using BAM input, write output as BED.

  	-header	Print the header from the A file prior to results.

  	-nobuf	Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line
  		of output to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved
  		in a buffer. This will make printing large output files 
  		noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction with
  		other software tools and scripts that need to process one
  		line of bedtools output at a time.

  	-iobuf	Specify amount of memory to use for input buffer.
  		Takes an integer argument. Optional suffixes K/M/G supported.
  		Note: currently has no effect with compressed files.

  Notes: 
  	(1) Input files must be sorted by chrom, then start position.
