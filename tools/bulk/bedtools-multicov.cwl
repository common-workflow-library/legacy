  Tool:    bedtools multicov (aka multiBamCov)
  Version: v2.25.0
  Summary: Counts sequence coverage for multiple bams at specific loci.

  Usage:   bedtools multicov [OPTIONS] -bams aln.1.bam aln.2.bam ... aln.n.bam -bed <bed/gff/vcf>

  Options: 
  	-bams	The bam files.

  	-bed	The bed file.

  	-split	Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.

  	-s	Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
  		that overlap A on the _same_ strand.
  		- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

  	-S	Require different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
  		that overlap A on the _opposite_ strand.
  		- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

  	-f	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of each A.
  		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
  		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

  	-r	Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for each A and B.
  		- In other words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires
  		  that B overlap 90% of A and A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.

  	-q	Minimum mapping quality allowed. Default is 0.

  	-D	Include duplicate reads.  Default counts non-duplicates only

  	-F	Include failed-QC reads.  Default counts pass-QC reads only

  	-p	Only count proper pairs.  Default counts all alignments with
  		MAPQ > -q argument, regardless of the BAM FLAG field.
