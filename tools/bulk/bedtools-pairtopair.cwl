  Tool:    bedtools pairtopair (aka pairToPair)
  Version: v2.25.0
  Summary: Report overlaps between two paired-end BED files (BEDPE).

  Usage:   bedtools pairtopair [OPTIONS] -a <BEDPE> -b <BEDPE>

  Options: 
  	-f	Minimum overlap required as fraction of A (e.g. 0.05).
  		Default is 1E-9 (effectively 1bp).

  	-type 	Approach to reporting overlaps between A and B.

  		neither	Report overlaps if neither end of A overlaps B.
  		either	Report overlaps if either ends of A overlap B.
  		both	Report overlaps if both ends of A overlap B.
  		notboth	Report overlaps if one or neither of A's overlap B.
  		- Default = both.

  	-slop 	The amount of slop (in b.p.). to be added to each footprint of A.
  		*Note*: Slop is subtracted from start1 and start2
  			and added to end1 and end2.

  		- Default = 0.

  	-ss	Add slop based to each BEDPE footprint based on strand.
  		- If strand is "+", slop is only added to the end coordinates.
  		- If strand is "-", slop is only added to the start coordinates.
  		- By default, slop is added in both directions.

  	-is	Ignore strands when searching for overlaps.
  		- By default, strands are enforced.

  	-rdn	Require the hits to have different names (i.e. avoid self-hits).
  		- By default, same names are allowed.

  Refer to the BEDTools manual for BEDPE format.
