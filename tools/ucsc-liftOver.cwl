  ucsc-liftOver.cwl is developed for CWL consortium
    usage:
       liftOver oldFile map.chain newFile unMapped
    oldFile and newFile are in bed format by default, but can be in GFF and
    maybe eventually others with the appropriate flags below.
    The map.chain file has the old genome as the target and the new genome
    as the query.

    ***********************************************************************
    WARNING: liftOver was only designed to work between different
             assemblies of the same organism. It may not do what you want
             if you are lifting between different organisms. If there has
             been a rearrangement in one of the species, the size of the
             region being mapped may change dramatically after mapping.
