          -bg Report depth in BedGraph format. For details, see
          genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bedgraph.html
          -bga Report depth in BedGraph format, as above (-bg).
          However with this option, regions with zero
          coverage are also reported. This allows one to
          quickly extract all regions of a genome with 0
          coverage by applying: "grep -w 0$" to the output.
          -d Report the depth at each genome position (with one-based coordinates).
          Default behavior is to report a histogram.

        description: |
          Scale the coverage by a constant factor.
          Each coverage value is multiplied by this factor before being reported.
          Useful for normalizing coverage by, e.g., reads per million (RPM).
          - Default is 1.0; i.e., unscaled.
