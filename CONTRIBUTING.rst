Introduction
------------

Thank you for considering to contribute to the Common Workflow Language community repository of workflow and tool descriptions.
It is people like you that power this community effort!

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the community members managing and developing this
open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping
you finalize your pull requests.

We welcome enhancements and fixes to existing tool or workflow descriptions along with new contributions. We equally
value documentation, tutorials, issue reporting, and peer support.

General CWL support questions are best posted to `Biostars.org under the CWL tag <https://www.biostars.org/t/cwl>`_.
